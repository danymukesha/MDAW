For untargeted data, it's like having a big box of different ingredients
without knowing what they are. We need to use special tools to identify
and measure each ingredient in the box. Once we have all the measurements,
we can start analyzing them to see if there are any patterns or differences
between the ingredients. For targeted data, it's like having a specific list
of ingredients that we already know. We can directly measure and analyze
these ingredients to see if there are any differences or changes
in their levels. Just like following a recipe for a cake,
the workflow for statistical analysis of metabolomics data helps us understand
and learn more about the different ingredients in our samples and
how they can impact our health and the world around us. After we have analyzed
both the untargeted and targeted data, we can compare the results and
see if there are any similarities or differences between the two groups.
This helps us understand how different ingredients or substances
in our samples may affect our bodies or the environment.
